For linux/unix compilation:
G++ is the only tested, working compiler, there is a bug in the program where clang will not work. Plan to fix on next release.
(for freebsd run: export GXX=/usr/local/bin/g++)
	
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

binaries are in the bin folder


For Windows 10
(NOTE: The unit tests will not compile on windows due to differences in the math libary locations)
Prebuilt Windows binaries are included in the Sprint3 github release

MinGW is required to build the program
